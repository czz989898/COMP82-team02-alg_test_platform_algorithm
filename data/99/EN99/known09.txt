A further three universities have made a commitment to join the conversation. The network will operate under Universities Australia. 

This new initiative is baded on similar programs already up and running on campuses across teh UK, the US, and Canada. The idea is to collaborate and share the best practice concepts to improve the health and wellbeing of more than 1 million students and 100,000 staff members. This will be done by increasing the availability of healthy fodd options on campus, enacting student-led resources for improving mental health and promoting safe and respectful relationships.
