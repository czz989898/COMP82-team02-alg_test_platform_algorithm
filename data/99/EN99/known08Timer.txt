The university teaches one to be independent, bold and courageous. This may not be apparent or visible during the day-to-day experiences during class hours or while solving assignments. However one realises this fact when he or she is done with University life. That time these 'real-life' skills tend to prove useful in all spheres be it professional lives or personal.
