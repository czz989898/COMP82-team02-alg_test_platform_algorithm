A plan that has main focus on acheiving low levels of stress can be the way to go in terms of promoting postitive experiences. To begin with, the university can have events that relieve the educational stresses that student face such as having festivals of sorts to take students minds away from studies. 
Moreover, the unviersity can also have mandatory activities that target students well-being and getting themselves acquainted with a variety of people to ensure they are not alone involuntarily, this would help provide a good support system for the student to fall back on to when needed. 
Staffs of the university should also be of more nuturing nature but still remain professional as a university requires strict professional conduct. In essence, the lecturers and staff can also attend mental health seminars to better help them understand the stressors that university student might face and structure their teachings and assessments 
accordingly. Additionally, a unviersity should also be concern for the future of the students and assists them in best way possible by manifesting a positive university experience.
