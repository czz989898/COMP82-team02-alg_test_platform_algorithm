Univerity is the forefront of education and should be held to the highest standards in terms of ensuring that a student receives the best possible care when enrolled.  Universities students have become increasingly vulnerable to adult pressures and it has become a growing concern as it impacts the dailiy lives of many. At this stage of live, 
university student should be given the ability to explore, make mistakes and learn what it means to be independent. However, due to excessive pressure of being unable to meet grade expectations and other externalities such as financial pressures, it makes the learning process ever more difficult. With this excessive pressure, it may potentially cause
harm to many in terms of their mental wellbeing. University have certain obligations to ensure the well-being of students are taken care of as it does affect their abilities to perform at an optimal level. Apart from that, a student is most likely going out to the workplace after the tertiary level but without adequate mental health support, the impacts that 
a student who is mentally unhealthy could impose is severe, such as work and jugdgement impairment that can affect their duty of care for the wider audience. Hence, a univeristy reputation might be at stake if the product of the university are students who are incapable of handling pressure and could lead to shortcomings in terms of its education services. 
The responsibility of a university also lies beyond the simple level of just educating student, a university must also prepare mentally stable student with the ability to function well in the real-world setting. 

However, a university does not have to make such attempts as it goes beyond their obligation as a professional institution. Moreover, the health and services that a university provides may be more deterimental to students if the right kind of help is not provided. With this, the unviersity may have more obligation to satisfy.
