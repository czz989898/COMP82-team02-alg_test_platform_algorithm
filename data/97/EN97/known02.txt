Organisational behaviour. The class had a very hands-on experience and the tutor made the class very enjoyable in the sense that it was very interative. There was never
a dull moment in the classroom as the tutor was constantly getitng invovled and looking out for the students. The atmosphere of the class was positive which created
a great learning environment which had made me want to learn more and look forward to the class.
