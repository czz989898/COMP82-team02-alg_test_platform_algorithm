A written assingment gives you the ability to research and understand a topic really in-depth as there's not so much of a time pressure. Without it, a person can perform 
optimally and understand what could not be understood. Hence making the prepartion process much more meaningful.

A final exam has all the time pressure and forces student to be able to grasp a variety of topics at one-go. Preparing for a final exam can be said to much more pressuring 
as there is no lee-way for misunderstanding and every answer may or must be on the dollar.
