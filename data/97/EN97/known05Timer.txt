My least favourite class would be intermicro economics. To begin with, the course syllabus in essence was hard to begin which makes the learning experience ever so more difficult. The tutor was not putting in the effort to explain the subject to her fullest extend which made it difficult for the whole class to understand the content
extensively. One of the steps is to make sure that the subject has enough contact hour before implementing such a heavy load, there was just not enough support to make the subject understandable. So more contact hours.
