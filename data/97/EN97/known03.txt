Group work segregation. It is important the each student share equal weigh in terms of handling the workload/assessment. With that being said, a proper plan involves everyone
and is fairly distributed but never to a specific extend. This stems from the reasoning of people being good at handling different task, some may be good at research, 
some at writing and some at presenting etc. Hence, the students should be place in groups of different abilities and are not subject to biases so that its an equal opporutnity
for everyone and there is no unfairness. The tutor/lecturer must also place heavy concerns on students who do not put in any effort and should punish them accordingly. 
Essentially, having a fail safe is important as to protect all university students interest.
