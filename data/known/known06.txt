Yes, because the university is a part of a student's support system. Therefore, there is a responsibility on the university's part to ensure the wellbeing of the student. This might or might not include academic support, financial support, emotional support, disability support or living support. 
The university should be proactive in ensuring students who require support or assistance, which is likely to be most students. 
In addition, university course content is often mostly theoretical, might benefit from being more practical as is needed in jobs. This might help relieve stress on the students as they know what they're studying is needed in future jobs. 

This answer is perfect.
