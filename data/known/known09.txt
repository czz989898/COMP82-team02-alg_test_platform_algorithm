Twenty-five universities have joined forces to promote physically and mentally healthy lifestyles for their staff and students, under the freshly minted Ausralian Health Promoting Universities Network. A further three universities have made a commitment to join the conversation. The network will operate under Universities Australia. 

This new initiative is based on similar programs already up and running on campuses accross UK, the US, and Canada. The idea is to colloborate and share best practice concepts to improve the health and wellbeing of more than 1 million students and 100,000 staff members. This will be done by increasing the availability of healthy food options on campus, enactingstudent-led resources for improving mental health and promoting safe and respectful relationships.

"Universities must be at the forefront of addressing major health challenges, such as improving mental health and preventing chronic diseases," said Universities Australia chair and vice-chancellor of Western Sydney University
