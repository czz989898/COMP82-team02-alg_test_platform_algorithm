i am not good at science subjects, but i took three science subjects in my first year first semester. i need to do a three hour lab every week. the positive side is sometimes it is a group work, it is better to work together and discuss all the science stuff. if i have any science quetsions, there are tutors helping most of the time. there are some past exam papers for you
