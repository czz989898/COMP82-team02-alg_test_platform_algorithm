Yes, in my opinion, I think University should definitely support the students improve their wellbeing since the period of student studying at the university is the time before they actually get into their dream career or the way they want to ive in the future.
When students are feeling stressed and experiencing mental health disorder, they may always think in a negative way, doubting themselves even though they may have the ability to do the work properly and solve the problem themselves. University should give them a helping hand where students need to get back their confident. University should try to guide them and lead them back to the right track.
Univeristy is not a place just for students to study, it is also a place for them to get connections with others, with the new world they have never explored. They may not open up themselves and try to explore the new things when they are stressful and feel pressure. They may try to hide themselves, and close down all the connections to the world and make them feeling even more depressed.
