You need to have certain knowledge of the subject when writing an assignment and preparing for an exam.
But you can still look up the notes, ask your tutor, friends whenever you are unsure or dont understand and do some more research online while writing an assignment. Unfortunately, you can only reply on yourself and write whatever is in your mind during the exam.
