Although the university provides  lot of counseling options , the university shoild also be concerned about the overall wellbeing of the student , not only the psychological wellbeing .
There is alot of pressure on students to finish assignments , projects on time ,, get good grades each and ery semester and perform well in the social and academic aspect of life
which makes the student vulenrable to presure , Adding to all these are the significant living costs which include buying textbooks , rent , transportation , food etc. 
Hence a university going student cannot tend to affod all these expenses without working part time as well. 
So i do think the university should assist in some of the aspects such as 
textbooks or providing free trasportation to all university going students.
