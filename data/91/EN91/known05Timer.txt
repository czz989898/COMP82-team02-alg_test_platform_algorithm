MY LEAST FAVOURITE CLASS IS THE DYNAMICS CLASS . ITS HIGH CONCEPTUAL AND REQUIRES A LOT OF FOCUS .TO ADD TO THAT SHE ONLY TAKES CLASS ON FRIDAYS WHICH IS BAD . THERE IS  a 2 HOUR BLOCK LECTURE WHICH IS FRUSTRATING AND THE SUBJECT ITSLEF IS PRETTY HARD
THE LECTURES SHOULD BE UQALLY DISRIBUTED WHICH WOULD REDUCE LOAD
